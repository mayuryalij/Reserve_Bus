# Reserve Bus

Reserve Bus is a modern and convenient platform for booking bus tickets online. Whether you're travelling for business or leisure, our user-friendly platform makes it easy to find and book the right bus for your needs. You can stay informed and make informed decisions about your travel plans with real-time updates.

The application is built using React, a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, and several React libraries and npm packages. We've used Redux to manage the global state in the application, React-Icons to add icons to our interface, React-DOM to work with the DOM in our React applications, and npm to manage the dependencies of our project.
